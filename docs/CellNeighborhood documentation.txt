CellNeighborhood documentation

CellNeighborhood contains two methods to detect spatial neighbors for index cells. The find() function is a modified version of cell neighborhood detection using spatial k-Nearest-Neighbors from Schuch et al. "Coordinated Cellular Neighborhoods Orchestrate Antitumoral Immunity at the Colorectal Cancer Invasive Front" (Cell 2020).

######################
CellNeighborhood.find(data_df, outdir, X='x:x', Y='y:y', cluster_col = 'CelltypeName', k = 10, n_neighborhoods = 15, drop=False, plot=True)
	performs kNN on spatial (X-Y) coordinates of each cell to generate a neighbors adjacency matrix and performs mini-kMeans clustering to identify indexed neighborhoods containing similar distributions of cell types, as implemented in Schuch et al., Cell 2020.

	data_df - DataFrame containing CODEX data from 1 or more tissues
		tissues should be uniquely indexed by "RunID" and "RegionID" levels of a MultiIndex

	outdir - path to where plots should be saved

	X - column name of data_df containing the X coordinate of each cell

	Y - column name of data_df containing the Y coordinate of each cell

	cluster_col - column name of data_df containing the annotation or class of each cell

	k - number of neighbors (kNN) to be detected for each index cell

	n_neighborhoods - number of centroids for kMeans clustering on neighborhood windows

	drop - list - cell annotation classes that should be excluded from neighborhood analysis
		example: ["Unassigned"] - cells with unknown or lack of distinguishing marker expression 

	plot - show and save the logOddsRatio for enrichment of cell types within clustered cell neighborhood over average numbers across all tissues
		shown as a clustered heatmap of log2Enrichment - Red is enriched within the neighborhood and Blue is displaced from the neighborhood

	Return:
	data_df - modified data_df with the kMeans cluster IDs appended as 'kmeans_neighborhood' columns
	windows - DataFrame of each cell from data_df and the classes of its k nearest neighbors
		this df facilitates visualization of the neighborhood structure with dimensional reduction apporaches (UMAP, tSNE) and application of more advanced alternative clustering methods such as leiden/louvain, DBScan, etc. 

	*** In testing, kMeans tends to under estimate neighborhood complexity and lead to spurious merging of neighborhoods, thus subsequent reclustering using the windows DataFrame is highly recommended


CellNeighborhood.delaunay(data_df, cluster_col='CelltypeName', drop=[], X='x:x', Y='y:y')
	performs delaunay triangulation on spatial (X-Y) coordinates of each cell to identify immediately adjacent neighbors of each index cell to estimate cell-cell contact interactions and does not require user defined "k" constant.

	data_df - DataFrame containing CODEX data from 1 or more tissues
		tissues should be uniquely indexed by "RunID" and "RegionID" levels of a MultiIndex
	
	cluster_col - column name of data_df containing the annotation or class of each cell

	drop - list - cell annotation classes that should be excluded from neighborhood analysis
		example: ["Unassigned"] - cells with unknown or lack of distinguishing marker expression 
	
	X - column name of data_df containing the X coordinate of each cell

	Y - column name of data_df containing the Y coordinate of each cell

	Return:
	delaunay_ids - DataFrame of each cell from data_df and the CellID of its Delaunay neighbors

	delaunay_annos - DataFrame of each cell from data_df and the classes of its Delaunay neighbors
		this df facilitates visualization of the neighborhood structure with dimensional reduction apporaches (UMAP, tSNE) and application of more advanced alternative clustering methods such as leiden/louvain, DBScan, etc. 

	*** Delaunay trianglulation does not return the same number of neighbors for each cell and thus may need to be normalized prior to clustering.
