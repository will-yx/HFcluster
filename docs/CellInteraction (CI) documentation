CellInteraction (CI) documentation

CellInteraction contains several containers for plotting cell-cell interactions and a statistical test for estimating confidence intervals using bayes_mvs

######################
CI.neighborinteractions(df, col_name, mode='interactions', drop=False, save=False, **kwargs)
	plots enrichment of cell types in proximity to eachother

	windows - DataFrame of each cell from data_df and the classes of its k nearest neighbors (from CellNeighborhood.find)

	col_name - column name of column name for categorical labels of each cell - e.g. 'CelltypeName'

	mode - ['logodd', 'interactions', 'norm_interactions', 'zscore', 'pct'] - mode of normalization for calculating enrichment
		logodd - log odd ratio - np.log2(((mean+tissue_mean)/(mean+tissue_mean).sum(axis = 1, keepdims = True))/tissue_mean)
		interactions - raw average interaction - mean
		norm_interactions - average interaction/expected interaction - mean/tissue_mean
		zscore - z-score normalized - (mean-tissue_mean)/tissue_std
		pct - percentile rank normalized

	drop - False or list - list of labels to drop before analysis - e.g. ['none','unassigned']

	save - False or path - path to save the resulting heatmap as a svg file

	**kwargs - passed onto clustermap,  see seaborn.clustermap()

	returns
	fc - Dataframe of celltype by celltype enrichment matrix within nearest neighbors - asymmetrical matrix, source cell is y-axis, neighbors on the x-axis

CI.networkmap(fc, edgemax=10, layout='circle', weight=pd.DataFrame(), sort=False, filter=None, r = 500, arc=0.02, self_edge=True, figsize=(10,10), save=False)
	plots a network graph of interactions

	fc - enrichment matrix - e.g. fc from CI.neighborinteractions

	edgemax - max width of edges

	layout - ['circle', 'spring', 'kamada_kawai'] or a list of positions - positions for nodes in the network 
		circle - nodes in alphabetical order on a circle
		spring - spring-directed layout based on edge weights see networkx.spring_layout
		kamada-kawai - another force directed layout see networkx.kamada_kawai

	weight - connection weights as an array - if empty, data from fc will be used

	sort - nodes in an order, must contain all nodes

	filter - simple threshold filter for edges with low weights

	r - radius

	arc - arc of the arrows

	self-edge - signal to self
	
	figsize - tuple of basebill size

	save - False or path - path to save the resulting image as a svg file

CI.bayes_test(data, alpha, threshold)
